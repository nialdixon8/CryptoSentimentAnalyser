# CryptoSentimentAnalyser
Python tool for calculating the sentiment of 1000s of reddit posts to find trends in the crypto market.

Uses sentiment analysis however the training data set used needs to be more orientated to reddit users

Could add a GUI aswell to  present the data nicely

Overall not very useful but with improvements could be a great analysis tool for finding trends in cryptocurrencys.
